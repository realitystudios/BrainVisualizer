## VR UI Kit: Material Design System

**Installation:**

-   Download Oculus Integration from the Asset Store and import it into your project
    
-   Download and import this package
    
-   Open the SampleScene. That's it!
    

**How to use:**
SampleScene in the Demo folder is a good place to start. It will show you the various VRUI prefabs that are available, along with a VRUIManager game object that control the color schemes.

To use the VRUI prefabs in your scene, first, add the VRUIManager game object, then add the VRUI prefabs from the Assets/Prefabs folder that you want to use. It is as simple as that.

Note: if you want to use this UI for non-VR apps, all you need to do is use the Standalone Input Module in the Event System instead of Oculus' OVR Input Module.
